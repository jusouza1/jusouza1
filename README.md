I'm a Brazilian software developer currently working with web development. I've been studying programming since 2020 and after a few months I got my first internship as a web developer at a Brazilian company that provides some research products for the Federal Government. I spent three months there and it was my first experience working with agile methods. Then, I've got a job as a trainee at Solinftec, where I learned Java, SQL, Docker, Kafka and much more. After the trainee program I was hired as a web developer  and I've been working there ever since.
